### Data Wrangling and Data Visualization
 
#### I. Intended Learning Outcomes:
To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data
To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will be used in data wrangling and data visualization

#### II. Instructions:
Download the ECE Board Exam 2 dataset found on this link: bit.ly/ECEBoardExamDataset and write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter notebook in the dedicated submission bin.

### ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM:
Using data wrangling and data visualization technique with storytelling, analyze the data and present different (i) data frames; and (ii) visuals using the dataset given.

#### 1. Create the following data frames based on the format provided:
Example: Vis = [“Name”, “Gender”, “Track”, “Math<70”]; hometown is constant as Visayas

Output:

 a. Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as Instrumentation and hometown Luzon

 b. Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is constant as Mindanao and gender Female

#### 2. Create a visualization that shows how the different features contributes to average grade. Does
chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contributes to a higher average score?
