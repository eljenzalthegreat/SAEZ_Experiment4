# SAEZ_ECE 2112 - Experiment 4

## Data Wrangling and Data Visualization

### Overview

This repository contains the code and analyses for Experiment 4 of the ECE2112 course, focusing on data wrangling and visualization using Python. The experiment utilizes the ECE Board Exam dataset to perform data cleaning and create meaningful visualizations about how different factors, such as track, gender, and hometown, impact students' average scores. The code demonstrate techniques for data manipulation with pandas and effective visualization strategies using libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn.

#### I. Intended Learning Outcomes:
1. To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data.
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will be used in data wrangling and data visualization.

### II. Instructions:
Download the ECE Board Exam 2 dataset found on this link: bit.ly/ECEBoardExamDataset and write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter notebook in the dedicated submission bin.

## ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM:

Using data wrangling and data visualization techniques with storytelling, analyze the data and present different (i) data frames; and (ii) visuals using the dataset given.

#### 1, Create the following data frames based on the format provided:

Example: Vis = ["Name", "Gender", "Track", "Math<70"]; hometown is constant as Visayas.

a. Filename: Instru = ["Name", "GEAS", "Electronics >70"]; where track is constant as Instrumentation and hometown Luzon.

b. Filename: Mindy = ["Name", "Track", "Electronics", "Average >=55"]; where hometown is constant as Mindanao and gender Female.

#### 2. Create a visualization that shows how the different features contribute to average grade. Does chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contribute to a higher average score?

## Personal Challenges I faced
I faced challenges in understanding how to filter and structure the data frames correctly. Moreover, the visualization task required careful thought to ensure it effectively conveyed the relationship between the features and average scores.
